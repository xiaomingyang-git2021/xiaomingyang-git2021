### About Me
## Hello!


Iâ€™m Xiaoming Yang, a Full Stack Web Developer from New York City. Currently I am a Pursuit Fellow, taking part in an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate.


I am working towards becoming a Full Stack Web Developer so that I can be a leader in tech, by strengthening my skills and continuing to learn each day.

I am looking to transition careers from the fashion industry to full stack web development, where my skills will be more in-demand and have the opportunity to grow. I would like to be part of a team that is innovative and allows me to continue learning and add value to the company.

Open to opportunities: Full-time, Apprenticeships, Volunteer Opportunities, Open Source Projects, Internships!
