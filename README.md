### About Me
## Hello!


  Iâ€™m __Xiaoming Yang__, a __Full Stack Web Developer__ from New York City. Currently I am a __Pursuit Fellow__, taking part in an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate.


  I am working towards becoming a Full Stack Web Developer so that I can be a leader in tech, by strengthening my skills and continuing to learn each day.

### Pursuit Fellowship Project

- [Dinosaur Museum Project](https://xiaomingyang-git2021.github.io/8-0-dinosaur-museum-project/)

  The Dinosaur Museum is opening! You've been tasked with building some challenging functionality for the automated systems recently    installed at the museum.

  To complete this project, you will need to write a number of difficult functions that will support attendees in finding out information about dinosaurs, finding the dinosaur's location, and calculating their entry fees.
  
  
- [Command Line Snowman Project](https://xiaomingyang-git2021.github.io/8-0-command-line-snowman/)

  For this assignment, you will build a game of [snowman](https://benstone1.github.io/Snowman-App/) that lets you play in the terminal!
  
- [Weather App Project](https://xiaomingyang-git2021.github.io/8-0-weather-app-project/)

- [React Calculator](https://the-awesome-xiaomingyang-git2021.netlify.app) 
  
  Create a React app that mimics a simple calculator

  This project requires you to build a web application that responsively changes based on user input. This project also uses an external API, which you will need to access and integrate into your project.
  
- [React YouTube](https://youtube-clone-34abc4.netlify.app/)

  This is a 3-person cooperation project. According to the requirements of the project, there should be an interface with clear YouTube features. When the user enters the searched movie name in the search box, the corresponding result can be given. Click the search result to start playing the video content. In addition, on the navigation bar of the homepage, users can see the information of the members of the creative team of this project.
  
- [Full Stack Budgeting App](https://xiaoming-budgeting-2022.netlify.app/)

  Create a backend API using Express that performs full CRUD on a single model, transactions. Then, using RESTful routes, connect it to a React app.
  
- [Tuner](https://xm-tuner-full-stack.netlify.app/)

  This is my first small app with database and backend and frontend. When you click on Tuner, you can see a list of songs. You can also add, delete or edit your favorite song list. Everyone is welcome to test this application. Since the backend is deployed on heroku, its response speed will be a little slow, and it takes a little patience to wait for its connection, which is hereby explained.
  
- [Snack-A-Log Pair Programming Lab](https://romantic-einstein-9a7ad6.netlify.app)

  This is a two-person partnership programming project. The purpose is mainly to examine the ability of cooperative programming. The project involves the integrated use of front-end, back-end and database. On the basis that the program can run normally, the back-end and front-end are respectively deployed to the heroku and Netlify websites to truly realize a website similar to the real environment. Items within the program can be edited and deleted. You are welcome to inspect and test our projects.
