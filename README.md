### About Me
## Hello!


Iâ€™m Xiaoming Yang, a Full Stack Web Developer from New York City. Currently I am a Pursuit Fellow, taking part in an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate.


I am working towards becoming a Full Stack Web Developer so that I can be a leader in tech, by strengthening my skills and continuing to learn each day.

For everyone, programming is no longer a patent of some people, everyone is interacting with the program every day, and everyone has the opportunity to become the inventor of the program. Let us enter the world of programming together. where my skills will be more in-demand and have the opportunity to grow. I would like to be part of a team that is innovative and allows me to continue learning and add value to the company.

Open to opportunities: Full-time, Apprenticeships, Volunteer Opportunities, Open Source Projects, Internships!
