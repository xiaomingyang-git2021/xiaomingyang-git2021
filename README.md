### About Me
## Hello!


  Iâ€™m __Xiaoming Yang__, a __Full Stack Web Developer__ from New York City. Currently I am a __Pursuit Fellow__, taking part in an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate.


  I am working towards becoming a Full Stack Web Developer so that I can be a leader in tech, by strengthening my skills and continuing to learn each day.

Let us enter the world of programming together. where my skills will be more in-demand and have the opportunity to grow. I would like to be part of a team that is innovative and allows me to continue learning and add value to the company.
